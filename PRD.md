# Task Manager Application PRD (Product Requirements Document)

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the detailed requirements for a comprehensive Task Manager application built using Next.js (App Router) with Tailwind CSS. The application allows users to create multiple task lists with nested subtasks, set priorities, track progress, and view analytics on their productivity.

## 2. User Personas

1. **Individual Productivity User**: Personal users managing their daily tasks and projects
2. **Team Member**: Users collaborating on shared projects with task delegation
3. **Project Manager**: Users overseeing multiple projects and team tasks

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1 List Management

Users can create, edit, and delete multiple task lists, each representing a project, category, or area of responsibility.

**Requirements**:

- Create new lists with customizable titles and descriptions
- Edit list properties (title, description)
- Delete lists with confirmation
- View all lists in a dashboard layout
- Each list operates as a container for related tasks

### 3.2 Task & Subtask Management

Tasks are the primary work items within lists. Tasks can exist within lists or independently, and can contain subtasks.

**Requirements**:

- Create tasks with title, description, and priority level
- Create subtasks as simple text items under parent tasks
- Tasks can exist either:
  - Within a specific list
  - As independent items in a personal task area
- Mark tasks/subtasks as complete/incomplete
- Edit task details (title, description, priority)
- Delete tasks and associated subtasks
- Optional functionality for attaching images to tasks
- Display completion status for each task/subtask

### 3.3 Priority Management

Tasks can be assigned priority levels to indicate importance and urgency.

**Requirements**:

- Three priority levels: High, Medium, Low
- Visual indicators for each priority level
- Ability to filter and sort tasks by priority
- Update priority level of tasks
- Priority-based analytics in user profile

### 3.4 Progress Tracking

Each list displays a visual progress bar indicating overall completion status.

**Requirements**:

- Automatic calculation of completion percentage based on completed tasks/subtasks
- Visual progress bar for each list
- Progress indicator updates in real-time when task status changes
- Progress analytics in user profile

### 3.5 User Profile & Analytics

A dedicated profile section showing task completion statistics and productivity metrics.

**Requirements**:

- Overall task completion rate
- Tasks by priority distribution
- Productivity trends over time (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Most active lists/projects
- Tasks completed vs. created ratio
- Average completion time for tasks
